## The Travails of The Knight's Travails

### Current state

Currently, the FindGoal() function finds the any square on the board. I did not implement a parent node attribute that I would need to be able to create the array of the moves that the knight took to get to the spot.  I may revisit this at a later date to implement that. 

I made this a webpack project, for if in the future I wanted to build out a UI, the key code is in src/index.js

Cheers!
